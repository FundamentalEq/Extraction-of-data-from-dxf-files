ACTIVITIES

* Discussed the bigger picture of the project, and individual roles and modules with Mrs.Srishti Srivastava

* Discussed with the Prof. Rajan and Mrs. Srishti about various ways to approch the problem of data abstraction.
 Two approches were "Parrallel Line approach" & "Polygon based approach"

* Finally it was decided that we will go ahead with "Polygon Based Approach" .

* It was also decided that for now I will work with clean data , and try to implement the Polygon based approach on it .

* Once the polygons are derived , the next level would be to derive center line of the polygon , followed by identification of closed spaces ..
